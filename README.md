# Unity Mini Projects

Small Unity projects and gameplay prototypes developed for learning and experimentation.

## Repository Overview

This repository contains a collection of mini Unity projects designed to explore different game mechanics, design patterns, and Unity features. Each project is self-contained and focuses on specific learning objectives.

## Projects

### Project 1: Basic Movement
**Location**: `Project1-BasicMovement/`

A 2D platformer prototype demonstrating:
- Player movement with WASD/Arrow keys
- Jump mechanics with ground detection
- Smooth camera following
- Physics-based character controller

**Key Concepts**: Input handling, Rigidbody2D, Physics2D, camera follow

[View Project Details](./Project1-BasicMovement/README.md)

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the project you want to explore
3. Open the project folder in Unity (2020.3 or later recommended)
4. Follow the project-specific README for setup instructions

## Requirements

- Unity 2020.3 or later (LTS recommended)
- Basic knowledge of Unity Editor
- C# programming fundamentals

## Learning Path

These projects are organized to progressively introduce Unity concepts:

1. **Project 1 (Basic Movement)**: Start here to learn fundamental input, physics, and camera systems

Future projects will explore:
- Advanced movement (wall jumping, dashing)
- Combat systems
- Inventory and UI
- Procedural generation
- AI and pathfinding
- Multiplayer basics
